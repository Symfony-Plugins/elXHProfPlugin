elXHProf plugin
==============

The `elXHProfPlugin` is a plugin to ease the use of [XHProf profiler](http://mirror.facebook.net/facebook/xhprof/ ).

It allows developers to easily profile code blocks thanks to a simple API.

This plugin also integrates XHProf runs into the web debug toolbar to see and compare them in a simple way.

This work was originaly realized for [PMSIpilot](http://www.pmsipilot.com/).

Prerequisite
------------
  * graphviz to have the graphs working (not mandatory)
  * XHProf PHP extension installed : [very good XHProf presentation and installation guide](http://techportal.ibuildings.com/2009/12/01/profiling-with-xhprof/)

Installation
------------

 * Install the plugin

         $ symfony plugin:install elXHProfPlugin

 * Deploy web dir by copying elXHProfPlugin/web content into sf_web_dir/elXHProfPlugin or executing the following command

         $ symfony plugin:publish-assets

How to profile
--------------
    $run = new XHProfRun('namespace');
    // Code to profile
    $run->end()
    
The namespace allows you to group multiple runs.

How to view/compare the results
--------------
The links to the runs results are available in the web debut toolbar. They are grouped by namespace and a distinguished by whether the runs have been done in the current PHP process or in previous processes.

You can compare 2 runs by checking them and clicking on the `Compare` button.

TODO
----
  * Ability to delete runs from debug toolbar
